This will be your master plan to learn and practice Flutter the awesome cross-platform UI framework for next 3 months. No worries you can take it on your own pace.

Hello, we are your mentors, and we are here to teach you the secret formula for learning Flutter and becoming a well-known Flutter developer. By the end of this action plan, you will not only have learned Flutter, but you will also be prepared to work as a Flutter developer.

However, you must ensure that you understand the instructions and take your practice seriously. We don't have a single blue or red pill that we can give you like Mr. Neo. If you want to be a great Flutter developer, we have hundreds of thousands of those pills for you to chew and swallow. We hope you like our action and strategy.

This is not an easy task for us to complete; we have been planning for a long time and are finally able to make this happen. It's a pleasure to meet our junior developer and future programmers.

## To ace this

- You really want to become a Flutter developer (either it’s passion or it’s money, you know there’s
  money in Flutter)
- You are disciplined and smart working (nothing can replace practice, you need to chew those pills
  we provide your)
- You know the basics of Computer and Internet (you might not be a wizard, but that’s what we are
  here to make you a Flutter wizard)

## Recommendations

- Complete each steps in the order provided
- But if you are brave and like to often wander, there might be hidden surprises inside each quest
