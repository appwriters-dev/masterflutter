title: Dart Programming Review
---

Wow, you have done it. You have learned all the basics of Dart that are essential to learn Flutter programming. In this chapter, we have covered the following topics:

1. Basics of Dart (variables, data types, operators, control flow, collections, null safety, and functions)
2. Object Oriented Programming (classes, objects, constructors, inheritance, and interfaces)
3. Dependency Management (pubspec.yaml, packages, and pub.dev)
4. Asynchronous Programming (async, await, and futures)

## Questions

1. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming?
2. What is the difference between a class and an object?
3. What is sound null safety in Dart? What are the benefits of sound null safety?
4. What does `dev_dependencies` mean in `pubspec.yaml`?
5. What is the `pub` CLI command to install a package?

## Projects

1. Build a CLI app that calculates the area of a different shapes. Display the menu as follows:

```bash
1. Circle
2. Rectangle
3. Square
4. Triangle
5. Exit
```
Based on user selection, ask for the required input and display the area of the shape. For example, if the user selects 1, ask for the radius and display the area of the circle. If the user selects 5, exit the program.

1. Build a CLI program when executed shows a random quotes of the day. Use the [Quotes API](https://quotes.rest/) to fetch the quotes. Parse the JSON response into Dart object and display the quote.

> **Note:** Make sure to add a nice Readme file to all your project with description, screenshots, and instructions to run the program. Publish each project once you complete to GitHub and share in your social networks.
