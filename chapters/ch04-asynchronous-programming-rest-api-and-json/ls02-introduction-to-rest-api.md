title: Introduction to REST API
---

REST API is a set of rules that developers follow to create APIs. REST stands for Representational State Transfer. It is an architectural style for designing networked applications. REST APIs use HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data. REST APIs are stateless, which means that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests. This makes REST APIs scalable and easy to maintain. REST APIs are also easy to understand and use. REST APIs are the most popular way to create APIs.

## JSON

JSON stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the [JavaScript Programming Language](https://www.javascript.com/), [Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards). JSON is the most popular way to send and receive data to and from a REST API.

## REST API Example

Let's take a look at a simple REST API example. We will use the [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) API, which is a fake online REST API for testing and prototyping. The API has a set of endpoints that return different types of data. For example, the `/posts` endpoint returns a list of posts, and the `/posts/1` endpoint returns a single post with the ID of 1. The API also has endpoints for users, comments, and todos. You can find the full list of endpoints in the [documentation](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/guide/).

## Projects

1. Write an Article about REST API
   
   Write an article about REST API. The article should include the following:

    - What is REST API?
    - What are the advantages and disadvantages of REST API?
    - What are the disadvantages of REST API?
    - What are the most popular REST API testing tools?
    - What are the most popular REST API documentation tools?

2. On Paper or Whiteboard, Draw a Diagram of a REST API
   
   Draw a diagram of a REST API. The diagram should include the following:

    - The client
    - The server
    - The HTTP request
    - The HTTP response
    - The data

3. Design a REST API
   
   Design a REST API on paper without actually programming. The API should include the following:

    - At least 3 endpoints
    - At least 3 HTTP methods
    - At least 3 HTTP status codes
    - At least 3 data types

4. JSON representation
   
    Create a JSON representation of a your friend. The JSON should include the following:
    
     - name
     - age
     - address
     - phone number
     - email address
