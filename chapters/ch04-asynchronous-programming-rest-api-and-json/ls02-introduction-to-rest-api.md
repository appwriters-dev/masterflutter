title: Introduction to REST API
description: REST (Representational State Transfer) API is a type of web service that uses the HTTP protocol to allow client applications to access and manipulate data on a server. REST APIs are popular because they are easy to use, scalable, and widely supported by a variety of client applications.

REST API is a set of rules that developers must follow when developing APIs. REST is an acronym that stands for Representational State Transfer. It is a networked application design architectural style. HTTP requests are used by REST APIs to GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE data. REST APIs are stateless, which means the server does not maintain any data (state) between requests. REST APIs are thus scalable and simple to maintain. REST APIs are also simple to understand and apply. REST APIs are the most commonly used method for developing APIs.

## JSON

JSON is an abbreviation for JavaScript Object Notation. It is a simple data interchange format. Humans find it simple to read and write. Machines can easily parse and generate it. It is built on a subset of the [JavaScript Programming Language](https://www.javascript.com/), as well as [Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards). JSON is the most commonly used format for sending and receiving data to and from a REST API.

## REST API Example

Let's take a look at a simple REST API example. We will use the [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) API, which is a fake online REST API for testing and prototyping. The API has a set of endpoints that return different types of data. For example, the `/posts` endpoint returns a list of posts, and the `/posts/1` endpoint returns a single post with the ID of 1. The API also has endpoints for users, comments, and todos. You can find the full list of endpoints in the [documentation](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/guide/).

## Projects

### 1. Write an Article about REST API

Create a REST API article. The following information should be included in the article:

- What exactly is REST API?
- What are the benefits and drawbacks of REST API?
- What are the drawbacks of REST API?
- Which are the most widely used REST API testing tools?
- Which are the most widely used REST API documentation tools?

### 2. On Paper or Whiteboard, Draw a Diagram of a REST API

Create a REST API diagram. The following elements should be included in the diagram:

 - The client,
 - the server, 
 - the HTTP request,
 - the HTTP response,
 - and the data are all involved.

### 3. Design a REST API

Design a REST API on paper without actually programming. The API should include the following:

- At least 3 endpoints
- At least 3 HTTP methods
- At least 3 HTTP status codes
- At least 3 data types

### 4. JSON representation

Create a JSON representation of a your friend. The JSON should include the following:

- name
- age
- address
- phone number
- email address
