title: Introduction to Asynchronous Programming
---

Asynchronous programming is a programming paradigm that enables a program to do more than one thing at a time. In asynchronous programming, long-running tasks run in the background without blocking the main execution thread. Asynchronous programming is very useful for performing I/O operations, such as accessing the network and accessing the file system. Asynchronous programming is also useful for performing time-consuming operations, such as image processing and mathematical calculations.

In Dart and Flutter asynchronous programming is used for a variety of tasks, such as:

* Making HTTP requests to a REST API
* Reading and writing files
* Doing heavy calculations
* Performing long running tasks, such as animations

In this chapter, we will learn about asynchronous programming in Dart and Flutter. We will learn about the `Future` class, the `async` and `await` keywords, and the `Stream` class.

## Projects

1. Every 5 Second
   
   Write a program that prints current time after 5 seconds.

2. Read a File
   
   Write a Program that reads a text file and prints the contents of the file to the console
