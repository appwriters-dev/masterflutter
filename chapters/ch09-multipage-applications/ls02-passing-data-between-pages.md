title: Passing Data Between Pages
---

Before we learn more advance techniques like state management, in this chapter we will practice how we can pass data from one widget to another.

## Projects

### 1. Authenticate

Build a Flutter App with two page, one for login and one for home. Login page should have a form with two text fields, one for email and one for password. When the user clicks on the login button, the app should navigate to the home page and display the email and password in a text widget.

> Do this twice, once with passing data using the constructor and `Navigator.push` and once with passing data using the `Navigator.pushNamed` method and extracting arguments using `ModalRoute`.
