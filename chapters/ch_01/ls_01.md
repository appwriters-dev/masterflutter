Recommended Time: 1 Day (But learn at your one pace)

In this lesson you will just get to know the Dart programming language briefly. If you have never done programming previously, don’t be overwhelmed or intimidated. We have further guides and lessons to prepare for you. Just spend more time on first chapter that way things will get easier and easier further you go.

## Resources

- [Language Tour](https://dart.dev/guides/language/language-tour)
- [Basic Dart Program](https://dart-tutorial.com/introduction-and-basics/basic-dart-program/)
- [DartPad](https://dartpad.dev)
- [Install Dart](https://dart.dev/get-dart)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Dart extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.dart-code)

## Projects

### 1. Hello world in Dart with DartPad

Write a program that will print hello world in the output.

- Use [DartPad](https://dartpad.dev) that way you don’t have to install Dart in your machine yet.

### 2. Install Dart in your device

Well, though you can move further in the chapter without installing Dart and just using the DartPad, we recommend you to install Dart in your machine.

- Use this [Getting Started Guide](https://dart.dev/get-dart) to download and install Dart in your system.
- Follow the guide step by step.
- Don’t get discouraged if you run into problems.
- Try again and again. Use google to search for errors if you receive any.

### 3. Write and run Hello world in Dart with VS Code

Well, once you have Dart installed, you also need a text editor where you can write your code. We recommend using VS Code.

- Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Install [Dart extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Dart-Code.dart-code) for VS Code
- Write and run a hello world Dart code using VS Code

### 4. Share in Social Network

Make a nice code screenshot with the hello world program you have written (use resource section to use a tool to create a code image) and share in your socials that you have started learning Dart & Flutter and you are more than excited to write your Hello world in Dart.
