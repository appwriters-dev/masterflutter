If the concept of Obejct Oriented Programming is new to you we recommend spending more time in these resources.

## Projects

1.  Gender Enum

    Write a dart program to create an enum class for gender [male, female, others] and print all values.

2.  Calculator

    Define a calculator class that has

    - methods `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide` and `setInitial` all accept one `double` parameter
    - has private nullable property `result` of type double
    - `setInitial` will set the initial `result`
    - all methods perform the desired calculation to the result and store the result
    - Create a test program with main method that initializes the calculator and performs operations

3.  Coordinate

    Create a class called `Point` allowing to manipulate a point of a plane (x,y).

    You will provide:

        - A constructor receiving as arguments the coordinates (double) of a point.
        - A member function "move" performing a translation defined by its two arguments (double).
        - A member function "display" simply displaying the coordinates of the point.

        The coordinates of the point should be private data members.

        Write separate files:
        - A source file constituting the declaration of the class.
        - A small test program (main) declaring a point, displaying it, moving it around and showing it again.

4.  Vector3D

    The class "vector3D" is defined as follows:

```dart
    class Vector3D {
    double _x, _y, _z;

    Vector3D(this._x, this._y, this._z);
    }
```

    - Add new named constructor `same` that have only one argument and initialize the three variables with it.
    - Add a member function "coincide" that check if two vectors have the same components.
    - A small test program (main)

5. Bank Client

   Create a class called BankClient that have 3 private attributes : - Id which is generated automatically and represents the order of the client in the bank Data Base (starting from 1 and can't be changed). - Name (can't be changed). - Balance have 3 methods (`getBalance`, `addToBalance`, and `subtractIfPossible`).

   - Create a constructor that use "Initializer list" to initialize the name.
   - Create a static method that print the number of clients and the bank balance.
   - Create a small test program (main) .

   Note : The balance is initialized at 0 and can't be negative.
