## Projects

1. Abstract Class

    - Create an abstract class called `ArticleDataSource` with method `getArticle(String id)`, and `deleteArticle(String id)`.
    - Create a class called `ArticleLocalDataSource` and implement the `ArticleDataSource`
    - Implement each method and print operation with the provided id. For example, calling `getArticle('dart-today-and-tomorrow')` should print `Get dart-today-and-tomorrow`
    - Add a factory constructor to `ArticleLocalDataSource` and return the object of `ArticleLocalDataSource`.
    - Instantiate `ArticleLocalDataSource` using the factory constructor and call each methods on the object.


2. Color Points

  The class "Point" is defined as follows:

```dart
  class Point {

    int _x, _y;

    Point(this._x, this._y);

    void move(int mx, int my) {

      _x += mx;

      _y += my;

    }

  

    void display() {

      print("x = $_x   y = $_y");

    }

  }
```
  - Define a new class `PointCol` derived from `Point` to manipulate colored points.
  - Its constructor initializes the color of the object with a given integer (the color reference).
  - Add a method "printColor" that print the color.
  - Create a small test program (main).

  8. Create a class "Client" that have 2 private attributes :
      - Name (can't be changed).
      - PurchasesAmount (double) have 2 methods (get, add).

  - Create a constructor that initialize the name.
  - Create a class "LoyalClient" that have 1 private attribute :
      - PurchasesAmount (double) have 1 methods (get).
  - Create a method "discount" that assign to PurchasesAmount (subclass) the value of PurchasesAmount (superclass) after reduction of 10%.
  - Create a small test program (main) .

  Note : Use different names for the get methods.
