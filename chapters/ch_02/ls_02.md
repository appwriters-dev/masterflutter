## Projects

1. Abstract Class

    - Create an abstract class called `ArticleDataSource` with method `getArticle(String id)`, and `deleteArticle(String id)`.
    - Create a class called `ArticleLocalDataSource` and implement the `ArticleDataSource`
    - Implement each method and print operation with the provided id. For example, calling `getArticle('dart-today-and-tomorrow')` should print `Get dart-today-and-tomorrow`
    - Add a factory constructor to `ArticleLocalDataSource` and return the object of `ArticleLocalDataSource`.
    - Instantiate `ArticleLocalDataSource` using the factory constructor and call each methods on the object.
