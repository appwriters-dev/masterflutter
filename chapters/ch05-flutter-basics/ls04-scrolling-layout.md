Most applications display a large amount of data that does not fit on a single screen. Especially for mobile applications with low screen real state. What are we going to do about it? With a scrollable area. We will practice displaying a large amount of data using a scrolling layout in this lesson. 'SingleChildScrollView' and 'ListView' are two important widgets to remember for this lesson.

## Projects

### 1. List of Names

Display a list of 100 names in a scrolling area. The list should be displayed in a `ListView` widget. Each item in the list should be a `Text` widget with a name. The names can be generated using the [faker](https://pub.dev/packages/faker) package.

### 2. List of Images

Display a list of 10 images in a scrolling area. The list should be displayed in a `ListView` widget. Each item in the list should be an `Image` widget with a random image. The images can be generated using the [faker](https://pub.dev/packages/faker) package.
