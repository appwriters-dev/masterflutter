Dependency management is integral part of modern programming. It is a process of managing the dependencies of a project. A dependency is a piece of code that is required by the project to run. It can be a library, a framework, a tool, or any other piece of code that is required by the project to run.

## Projects

### 1. Pub CLI

Create a simple program that uses the pub command-line tool to add, remove, and list the dependencies of your project. This project will help you understand the basics of using pub to manage the dependencies of your Dart project.

### 2. Using Dependency

Create a simple program that uses the `package:` URI syntax to import and use a package from the Dart package repository.
