Theming allows you to change the look and feel of your application. It is a useful feature that allows you to change the appearance of your application without changing the code. You can customize your application's colors, fonts, and other visual elements.

## Projects

### 1. Understanding Theme

Create a new Flutter project. Update the theme so that scaffold background color is `white`, `AppBar` background color is `lime`. Update the existing `Text` widget to use the `headline1` style (check `Theme.of(context).textTheme`).

### 2. Text Theme

Use [Google Fonts](https://pub.dev/packages/google_fonts) package to add a new font to your application. Update the theme of your App so that the all the headlines uses `Intra` font where as body text uses `Open Sans`.
