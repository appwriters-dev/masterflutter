In this lesson we will learn about various widgets that are used to create a basic layout following the Material Design guidelines. We will be using the following widgets:

1. Material App
2. Scaffold, 
3. AppBar
4. FloatingActionButton
5. BottomNavigationBar

## Projects

### 1. Flutter Create

Create a new Flutter project. Open the project in VS Code. Now open the `main.dart` file and investigate the code. You will see that the code is already written for you. This basic app already uses `MaterialApp`, `Scaffold`, `AppBar`, and `FloatingActionButton` widgets. Investigate how they are used. You can also run the app to see how it looks. You can try changing the different properties assigned to the widgets to see how it affects the app.

### 2. Build The Following Layout

Build following layout using the Material design widgets.

### 3. People App

Create a Flutter application that displays a list of people from a Json file. The app should have the following features:

1. The app should have a `Scaffold` widget as the root widget.
2. The app should have an `AppBar` widget at the top of the screen.
3. The app should have a `FloatingActionButton` widget at the bottom right of the screen.
4. The app should have a `BottomNavigationBar` widget at the bottom of the screen.
5. The app should have a `ListView` widget that displays the list of people.
7. The app should have a `Card` widget that displays the details of a person.
