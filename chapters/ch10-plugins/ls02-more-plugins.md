## Projects

### 1. Photo Picker

Write a Flutter application that allows the user to select a photo from their device's photo gallery. Display the selected photo in the app.

> **Hint:** Use the [image_picker](https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker) plugin. Use `Image.file` to display the selected photo.

### 2. Take a Picture

Update above program, so that user can choose to either pick a image from gallery or take a picture using the device's camera. Display the selected photo in the app.

### 3. Take a Picture and Save

Write a Flutter program that uses the device's selfie camera to take a picture and save, then display the saved photo in the app in another page.

> **Hint:** You can follow the [Using the device camera](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook/plugins/picture-using-camera) tutorial, but remember to make beautiful design for your app.
