In this lesson, you will go over Dart's standard input and output. You will learn how to accept user input and display output in various formats.

## Projects

### 1. Welcome User

Receive user's name as input and display `Welcome <user's name>` as output

### 2. Two Fer

Ask user to inpute a name, return a string with the message:

```
One for {name}, one for me.
```

Where `{name}` is the input from the user.

However, if the name is missing, return the string:

```
One for you, one for me.
```

Here are some examples:

| Name  | String to return           |
| ----- | -------------------------- |
| Ram   | One for Ram, one for me.   |
| Shyam | One for Shyam, one for me. |
|       | One for you, one for me.   |
| Alice | One for Alice, one for me. |
