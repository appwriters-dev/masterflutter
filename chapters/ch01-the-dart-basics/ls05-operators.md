Operators are an essential part of programming. They enable us to manipulate data in a variety of ways.

Dart includes a large number of built-in operators for performing various types of operations. **Unary operators** take only one operand, whereas binary operators take two operands with operators. There are various kinds of operators. The list of Dart Operators is as follows.

## Projects

### 1. Get Sum of Two Numbers

Write a program to calculate sum of two numbers.

- Store both numbers in variables
- Store the answer in a variable and display the answer.

### 2. Temperature Converter

Write a program that converts a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius, and then prints the result to the console. The formula for converting a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius is:
