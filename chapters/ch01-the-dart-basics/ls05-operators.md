Operators are an essential part of programming. They enable us to manipulate data in a variety of ways.
Dart includes a large number of built-in operators for performing various types of operations. Unary operators take only one operand, whereas binary operators take two operands with operators. There are various kinds of operators. The list of Dart Operators is as follows.

## Projects

### 1.check two strings are equivalent or not

Write a program to check whether two String a and b are equivalent not not.

- store a has a and b has b
- print (a==b)
- output is false

### 2.check one nullable variable and place default value for that

Write a program to check one nullable variable and place default value for that

- make one String type variable like, enterName can be nullable (final String? enterName )
- print a enterName by using ?? conditional operator (like, print(enterName ?? "your name"))
