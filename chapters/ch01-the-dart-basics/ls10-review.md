4. What is an **`if`** statement, and how do you use it to make decisions in your code in Dart?
5. What is the **`dynamic`** type, and when would you use it in Dart?
6. How do you use the **`print()`** function to print output to the console in Dart?

1. Write a program that reads a list of numbers from the standard input, and then prints the sum of the numbers to the standard output.
2. Create a simple calculator program that allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
3. Write a program that generates a random password based on user-specified criteria, such as length and the inclusion of special characters.
4. Create a simple to-do list program that allows the user to add, remove, and view their tasks.
5. Write a program that uses the Dart **`math`** library to calculate the area and perimeter of a circle, given the radius as input.
6. Create a simple program that uses the Dart **`http`** library to make an HTTP request and print the response to the console.
