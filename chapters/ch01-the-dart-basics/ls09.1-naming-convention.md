Dart Effective Style Guide and Naming Convention provides a set of guidelines for writing Dart code that is easy to read, easy to change, and easy to maintain. The guidelines are intended to be used by all Dart users, whether you are writing a small program or a large-scale application. These guidelines help set standard across teams and projects.

## Practice

- Use `lowerCamelCase` for variable names, function names, parameter names, and named constants.
- Use `lowercase_with_underscores` for directories, and files.
