Fonts are ways to enhance the design of your app. Flutter provides a way to use custom fonts in your app.

## Projects

### 1. Your Name in Two Different Custom Fonts

Create a new Flutter project and add two custom fonts to it. Use the fonts to display your name in two different fonts.

### 2. Google Fonts

There is also a [Google Fonts](https://pub.dev/packages/google_fonts) package that provides a lot of fonts. Update the above program to use this package instead of adding fonts to assets.
