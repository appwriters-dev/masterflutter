Fonts are ways to improve the look of your app. Flutter allows you to use custom fonts in your app.

## Projects

### 1. Your Name in Two Different Custom Fonts

Create a new Flutter project and fill it with two custom fonts. Display your name in two different fonts by using the fonts.

> Hint: You can download free fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com)

### 2. Font in Themes

Create a new Flutter project and fill it with two custom fonts. Change the app's theme so that headlines use one of the two fonts and body text uses the other. Then create a simple layout with a headline and an article.
