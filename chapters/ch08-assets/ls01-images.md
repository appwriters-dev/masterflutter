Images are a common type of asset in mobile applications. We will learn how to include images in our application and use them in the user interface.

## Projects

### 1. Your Business Card

Create a UI that displays your business card along with your photo. Your photo should be kept inside `assets/images` folder. You can use any image you like.

> **Note:** Use `Image.asset` to load the image from assets. Check [pubspec assets](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/assets-and-images#declaring-assets) for more information.

### 2. Dice Roller

Refactor dice app from previous chapter to use the image of Dice instead of the number.
