Images are one of the widely used assets in mobile applications. We will learn how to include images with our application and use them in UI.

## Projects

### 1. Your Business Card

Create a UI that displays your business card along with your photo. The UI should look like this:

<!-- Image -->

Your photo should be kept inside `assets/images` folder. You can use any image you like.

> **Note:** Use `Image.asset` to load the image from assets. Check [pubspec assets](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/assets-and-images#declaring-assets) for more information.
