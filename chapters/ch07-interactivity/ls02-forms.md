Forms are the most common way to collect user input.

## Projects

### 1. Login UI

Build a login UI with a username and password field and a Login button. When the user clicks the button, show a message that says "Welcome, [username]!" if the username is "admin" and the password is "1234". Otherwise, show a message that says "Invalid username or password".

> Note: Use a [TextField](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/TextField-class.html) for the username and password fields. Use a [TextEditingController](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/TextEditingController-class.html) to get the text from the fields. Remember to use [StatefulWidget](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/StatefulWidget-class.html). Use [SnackBar](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/SnackBar-class.html) to show the message.
