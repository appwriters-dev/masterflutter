Alerts and Dialogs are a way to show a message to the user and ask for their response.

## Projects

### 1. Login Dialog

Build a Welcome UI that has two buttons that says Login and Signup. When Login button is pressed show a dialog that has two text fields for username and password and two buttons for Login and Cancel. When Login button is pressed show a message "Welcome [Username]". Cancel button should hide the dialog. Similarly, when Signup button is pressed show a dialog that has three text fields for name, username and password and two buttons for Signup and Cancel. When Signup button is pressed show a message "Welcome [name]". Cancel button should hide the dialog.

> Note: Separate the UI logic into different widgets and use them in the main widget.
